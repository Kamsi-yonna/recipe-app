 I peel and mince 4 cloves of garlic.\nAlong with a few glugs of EVOO, some sea salt, and some cracked black pepper, I mix all this savory yumyum into a paste in a bowl.\nThen I spread it liberally along what will be the inside of my meat-wad.  See the strings laid out below?  Im going to fold this slab in half, encasing my herbaliciousness in the inside.\nSee?  I slide this baby into a ziplock bag and set it in the fridge to marinate for a few hours (overnight will work, too).  Its going to take at least 2 hours to roast, so I take it out around 4:00 pm\nAnd get my roasting pan set to high heat with a few glugs of EVOO shimmering on the surface.\nIm going to sear every surface of my luscious wrapped pink pig, which will help it cook through to tender later.  I leave the fat-cap for last.  Bottoms down!\nThen cut side, using tongs to flip when the surface has caramelized to a lovely golden brown.\nI even brown each tip, like so.\nFinally, I press the sweet sweet slice of quivering pork skin onto the searing hot oiled surface of my pan. After a few moments, I flip it the final time.\nThe house has already started to spell amazing, and the beautiful bacony aromas released once fat hits heat is almost more than I can handle.  Almost.  The promise of porcine perfection to come keeps me in check.\nOh, Ive nestled a few thick slices of white onion under my pork roast, because I dont want the bottom to oversear before the meat can release some juices, and then I dont want the bottom to stew in those juices too much.  The onion elevates the roast while adding flavor.  I wrap this in foil paper, and set into a\nOven.  It will bake for at least 2 hours; larger roasts will take longer, but for 2 people this is just the right size, and just the right amount of time to inhale the noxious tantalizing aromas before some sort of crazy sets in.\nI make my cucumber yoghurt right away, because I want the flavors to blend.  I start my peeling, then slicing\nThen chopping my cucumber.\nI throw it into a bowl, along with my yoghurt, 2 cloves of minced garlic, some lemon zest, the juice of 1/2 that lemon, some sea salt, cracked black pepper\nAnd I mix it all well.  I set this in the fridge, so all the flavors can come together.  Which they do oh, baby they do.\nWhen my roast is almost done (pretty much right at the 1:45 mark), I prep my spuds by splitting them into quarters, and tossing them with lots of EVOO, sea salt, cracked black pepper, and another 1/2 cup of chopped fresh rosemary and oregano.  Were bringing the scent and savory of the pork and potatoes together by lacing them both with the same herb blend.\nI spread these out on a sheet pan, and give them another healthy dose of EVOO, just to be sure theyre very heartily coated.  I set this into the bottom shelf of my oven, right above the heating element, so that my edges will crust up nicely. Youll see.\nWe purchased this lovely bottle of oregano scented white balsamic vinegar at O&Co. on Newbury Street.  Tonight was the perfect time to break it out.  Have you ever had french fries with vinegar?  If not, I highly recommend it.  This is the same concept.\nI had set aside the large bowl in which Id tossed my spuds; it was still coated with residual herbed EVOO, salt, and pepper.  Ive sliced my white onions into strips, and I toss them into this reservoir with another few healthy glugs of oil, and another handful of oregano leaves.  Heres where my vinegar comes in; I douse a healthy serving over this beautiful blend, stirring it all up very very well, soaking each each crisp slice of white root with dressing.

I can easily twist a wee bit of meat off with my fork, letting me know it is tender and perfectly ready to serve. I set the heat to 425, then stick my roast back in the oven so the skin can crisp.\nMeanwhile, my onions have pickled\nAnd Ive layered my baby spinach over them\nBefore I pour my spuds, sizzling oil and seared spices and all, over the whole pan.\nI toss this very well, letting the hot potatoes and oil wilt my spinach, and blending the pickled onions over the whole batch.\nMy pork is ready to go: the fat cap is crisped and blistered, and the meat is fork-tender.\nThis hunk of lovemeat almost slices itself, and the herbage cleavage is like a vein of precious green flavor gold.\nTopped with a cool cucumber cream, my thick, tender  slabs of herbed rolled pork roast with crispy, savory skin are perfectly partnered with my snappy spuds and buttery greens.

Cook until potatoes are tender.\nAdd chopped Broccoli (florets and steams). Remember to leave out a few florets for later use though.Cover with lid, when broccoli is tender, turn heat off.\nTransfer contents of pot into a large mixing bowl. Allow to cool slightly. Add to the bowl the fresh parsley, Chobani and almond milk. Fold new ingredients into the hot soup mixture.\nIn batches, puree the soup in a food-processor (maybe someday soon, a Vitamix!) style blender. Soup should be smooth-no lumps or chunks. In the soup pot, add the broccoli florets, a dash of veggie broth and saute covered for about a minute until tender. Add the pureed soup back into the soup pot. Add a bay leaf and a few pinches of chopped basil (optional). Simmer uncovered for at least twenty minutes to cook out all the air bubbles. Stir constantly for the first few minutes.

Once the onions and peppers are soft, but now brown, add the soaked basmati rice (make sure not to get any water in it!). Saute for 5-7 minutes. You want to toast the the rice.\nRemove the squash from the oven and cool for a few minutes before handling. Score the squash into small cubes, WITHOUT cutting through the skin. Scoop the cubes out into a bowl and set aside. Keep the shell aside, DONT throw out!\nOnce the rice is toasted add 1 cup of water, pinch of saffron, cover and cook on medium-low heat, about 15 minutes. You want the rice to be cooked thru, not mushy so dont mix it around too much! Once the rice is cooked, add the cubed squash, tossing gently (you dont want the squash to break and mush around the rice). Add the Biryani paste and toss to coat. Mix in 3/4 of the chopped cilantro. Taste for salt and biryani flavor- it should be strong, spicy and aromatic.\nIn a small skillet, spray with PAM and set over medium-high heat. Add onion slices, and saute without breaking up the circles. Cook until brown-ish about 4-5 minutes. Set aside.\nFill each squash bowl with rice, just coming over the top. Top each one with an onion round and sprinkle with remaining chopped cilantro. Serve with yogurt or raita.\nBiryani paste:\nIn a medium skillet, spray with pam, add oil and set over medium-high flame. Add onions and tomatoes, saute until golden-brown about 4-5 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, chili powder and cilantro. Saute until vegetables are soft and fragrant about 4-5 minutes. Add the biryani paste and mix well, making sure all the veggies are coated. Remove from the heat and let cool (10-15 minutes).\nIn a grinder/food processor, add the biryani mixture and grind until smooth (slightly chunky is ok). Store in an air tight container. Can be kept in the fridge for 1-2 weeks, or in the freezer- for a while!"},{"id":658536,"title":"Roasted Cauliflower and Leek Soup","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/658536-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":4,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/C3QSZ5T7/roasted-cauliflower-and-leek-soup","sourceName":"Foodista","summary":"Roasted Cauliflower and Leek Soup is a <b>gluten free, dairy free, paleolithic, and lacto ovo vegetarian</b> recipe with 4 servings.
