(Grease bottom only! I also like to line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release of the cheesecake from the pan when it has cooled.)\nTo prepare the cheesecake\nIn a double boiler, melt together the  cup whipping cream and 1 cup pf white chocolate chips. You want this just at the melting point, so be careful not to overheat it. Let it cool to lukewarm if necessary after melting. Set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the cheesecake batter.\nCream together the cream cheese and  cup sugar for a few minutes, scraping the bowl often.\nAdd the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.\nStir in the vanilla extract and melted white chocolate.\nFinally blend in the 1 cup of whipping cream until smooth.\nPour over the prepared base and bake in a bain marie (See Note) at 325 degrees F for 60 to 70 minutes. The cheesecake may be beginning to lightly brown at the edges but a cheesecake does not need to brown at all to be fully baked. The surface of the cheesecake should lose any shine when the cake is properly baked. It can still be slightly wobbly just at the center at this point.\nRemove the cake from the oven and run a sharp knife completely around the edge of the pan. This will allow for the cheesecake to shrink as it cools and hopefully not crack (but who cares if it does? I am never bothered by a crack or two in the surface)\nAllow the cheesecake to cool thoroughly on a wire rack at room temperature. (Do not put a hot cheesecake into the fridge to cool quickly, this may result in an under baked cheesecake because the residual heat actually continues to set the cheesecake after it comes out of the oven).\nTo finish the cheesecake\nWhen completely cool cover the top with fresh raspberries and garnish with melted white chocolate if desired.\nChill completely in the refrigerator until ready to serve."},{"id":642256,"title":"Eggless Cardamom and Chocolate Cheesecake","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/642256-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":12,"readyInMinutes":90,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/PH6RYZVL/eggless-cardamom-and-chocolate-cheesecake","sourceName":"Foodista","summary":"Eggless Cardamom and Chocolate Cheesecake requires around <b>1 hour and 30 minutes</b> from start to finish.
