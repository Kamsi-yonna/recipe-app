Take about a tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture and dollop it on the wide end of each crescent roll. Roll them up until the narrow end is sealed underneath. Transfer them to the prepared baking sheet and brush them with the egg wash. Sprinkle with turbinado sugar.Place the crescent rolls in the oven and bake for 13-15 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Remove from heat and transfer to a wire rack to cool.While the crescent rolls are cooling, prepare your glaze. In a medium bowl, combine the remaining  cup of confectioner's sugar, remaining  teaspoon of almond extract, and milk. Whisk until smooth. Adjust seasoning by adding a pinch of sea salt if you find that the glaze is too sweet. Drizzle the glaze on the slightly cooled crescent rolls and serve immediately.

Using a potato masher or your wooden spoon, lightly crush the potato chunks in the reserved potion of the soup. Add the pureed soup back to the pot and return to a low burner to keep the soup hot. Add in the 2 c. cheese, stir until melted, then add in the sour cream, stir well. Season to taste with salt & pepper. (Sometimes I like to add some of the crisped bacon into the soup mixture at this point, but that's optional.)\nTo serve, top bowls of soup with crisped bacon and potato skins, additional cheddar, sour cream and sliced scallion."},{"id":635235,"title":"Blackberry Pie With Lemon Verbena Whip Cream","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/635235-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":10,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/BKV765DR/blackberry-pie-with-lemon-verbena-whip-cream","sourceName":"Foodista","summary":"Blackberry Pie With Lemon Verbena Whip Cream is a <b>lacto ovo vegetarian</b> recipe with 10 servings.

Place a large heavy bottomed pot on the stove top (like a Le Creuset pot).\nOver medium heat cook 4 strips of Bacon in the large heavy bottomed pot until crisp.  Remove from the heat and allow to drain on paper towels.  Later you will crumble the Bacon into the finished Sauce.  Reserve the Bacon Fat in the pot.\nDry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel.  The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry.  This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish.\nCut the Short Ribs into 3-4 inch sections.  Trim some of the excess outer fat, leaving some for flavor.  Season the Short Ribs with Sea Salt and Black Pepper.\nOver medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear.  Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly.  You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well.   You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage.  The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle.\nPlace the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings.\nAfter all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit.  Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 T of fresh Olive Oil and saute the sliced Mushrooms until browned and crisp. 7-10 minutes.\nThen over medium heat add the diced Onions and Carrot and saute until soft, 5-7 minutes.  Add the minced Garlic and cook for 1 minute more.\nDeglaze the pot by adding 2 cups of Cabernet Sauvignon.  As soon as you add the Wine increase the heat to high and stir rapidly, scraping the bottom of the pot releasing the cooked on brown bits stuck to the bottom.  Bring to the boil then add 2 cups of Beef Stock and the Tomato Paste, Beef Base, Thyme, Bay Leaves, Sea Salt and Black Pepper.  Allow to boil, stirring continuously for 3 minutes.\nAdd the Beef Short Ribs and any juices that collected in the bowl to the boiling pot.  Put them in snugly against each other and boil for 2 minutes.\nThen place the lid on the pot and place in the center of the oven and cook for 3 hours at 300 degrees undisturbed.  Don't peek and release the moist heat that will make these Short Ribs fall of the bone.\nAfter 3 hours remove from the oven and take off the lid.  Prepare for a steam facial!  Remove the Cooked Beef Short Ribs to a large bowl.  Be gentle, it will be falling off the bone.  Allow the Sauce to sit for 3 minutes so the fat rises to the top.  Skim off the fat using a large spoon and discard it.  Remove as much as you can.  Remove the Bay Leaves and stems from the Thyme if you used fresh Thyme.\nRemember, the pot is HOT, it just came from the oven!!!  Use pot holders and place the pot of defatted Sauce over medium high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and reduce by a third.  This will concentrate the Sauce into a rich incredible Sauce. Taste the Sauce and add Sea Salt and or Black Pepper is needed at this point.  Crumble the Bacon and add to the Sauce stirring in well.\nAdd the Beef Short Ribs back to the pot of reduced Sauce and remove from the heat.  Coat the Short Ribs in the Sauce well.  Serve Immediately over Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes or Polenta."},{"id":658108,"title":"Red Velvet Cupcake","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/658108-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":24,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/2MQJTPWZ/red-velvet-cupcake","sourceName":"Foodista","summary":"Red Velvet Cupcake might be a good recipe to expand your dessert recipe box.

water boiling and cook your chicken breasts in one and your sausage in the other. I usually boil my chicken breasts for 15-20 minutes until the juices run clear when cut into, then cube them. For the sausage, slice it into bite sized pieces and boil for 10 minutes. Set aside after cooking to use later with the gumbo.\n\n\nThe roux is the most important part of a gumbo. If you don't get the roux right, you are probably not going to like your gumbo. There are many recipes you can try for a roux, but this is probably going to be one of the best you have ever had if you are a true gumbo fan. Let's get start making the gumbo.\n\n\nOver medium heat in a large pot, add your olive oil. Allow to warm for a minute, and then add in the flour. Stir constantly until all of the flour has disolved and the mixture has a lot of tiny bubbles. Once you have reached that consistency it's time to add in your garlic powder. Allow to bubble, constantly stirring for one minute.\n\n\nGradually stir in the chicken broth and the beer, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a slow simmer. Add the celery, all tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, parsley, and cajun seasoning.

Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly until the the mixture begins to thicken and then simmer lightly until thickened. Remove from heat and mix with the drained vegetables and turkey.Step 3: Fill two pie crusts with your turkey and vegetable mixture. Carefully top each pie with another pie crust, pinching the sides together. Cut several small slits into the top of the pie crust to allow the pies to vent while cooking.Step 4: Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the pies are golden brown, about 30 minutes. If the tops of the pies are browning too quickly, place a sheet of foil over the pie crusts and continue to bake. Cool for about 10 minutes before serving.This has to be one of the most delicious pot pie recipes I have ever tasted! What a great way to use up that leftover turkey. Another great substitution for turkey would also be to use a Rotisserie chicken. MMmmmm. I will be trying that soon.Have you ever tried a pot pie recipe? What about a Turkey Pot Pie Recipe?

free"],"dishTypes":["lunch","main course","main dish","dinner"],"cuisines":["European","Irish"],"instructions":"Season both sides of the corned beef liberally with pepper. The corning of the beef makes the beef salty enough, so no need to add more.\nHeat 1 TBSP oil in a large, shallow oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear each side for about 3 minutes, just to develop a nice brown crust. This will seal in the beef's juices.\nRemove beef to a plate. Pour guinness into the pot to deglaze. Scrape up any browned bits. Add beef broth, pickling spice, brown sugar, bay leaf, and minced garlic. Bring mixture up to a simmer.\nReturn the beef to the pot with any additional juices that have accumulated on the plate.\nCover the pot and place on the bottom rack in your oven. Bake for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or until a fork can easily be inserted into the meat.\nBaste the meat with the surrounding juices every 30 minutes or so.\nAfter 2 hours, add carrots, parsnips, and potatoes to the pot. They will only take about 25-30 minutes of simmering to cook.\nRemove pot from the oven. Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened. Place the cabbage on the serving platter with the other vegetables.\nStrain the sauce in the pot and stir in 2 or 3 TBSP of spicy honey mustard until dissolved. Place in a small dish or gravy boat with a ladle and serve alongside the beef.\nAfter slicing the beef and arranging it on the serving platter, ladle the guinness mustard sauce over the top to rehydrate and glaze the beef and vegetables."}]},"mtime":1712891746304,"integrity":"W28zXw8zrr"}
