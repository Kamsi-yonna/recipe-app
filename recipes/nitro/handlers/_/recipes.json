Select firm, meaty peppers without wrinkles for roasting. Wash thoroughly. Place peppers evenly in a single layer on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Place under broiler. Watch them closely as the skin will blister and turn black within minutes. Turn the peppers after 5 minutes to blister all sides evenly. When done, the pepper skins should be evenly blistered and mostly black. Place roasted peppers in a plastic bag, cover with a kitchen towel and when cool, rub off blackened skin. Tear open and pull out the seed pod and stem.\nSauce\nIn a blender combine the peppers, flour, and half of the suero or buttermilk and blend until creamy. Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.\nChicken (Optional)\nIn a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred. Optional time-saver: shred a store bought rotisserie chicken.\nStacked Style\nFry tortillas in hot oil until softened. Drain on paper towels. Soften tortillas by soaking in sauce one at a time. Place softened tortillas on individual serving plates. Layer with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Repeat process for a total of 3 tortillas for each serving.\nOven Style\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the sauce in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Fry tortillas in hot oil just until softened. Drain on paper towels. Fill with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Roll, placing seam side down.\nPour 2 cups of the sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco and bake until warm, about 15 minutes. Serve with a dollop of crema or sour cream and your favorite side dish."},{"id":660709,"title":"Southwest Blt Crostini","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/660709-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":10,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/6RVXH4TB/southwest-blt-crostini","sourceName":"Foodista","summary":"Southwest Blt Crostini is a Mediterranean hor d'oeuvre.

For this you take 1/2 cup of flour and place in a large bowl with the half cup warm water and the yeast. Cover the bowl with plastic and let stand anywhere from 2-8 hours. This is to allow it to ferment, I personally couldn't wait the whole time, I think I made it a minute past the 2 hour mark.\nStir in the 1 cup of water a little at a time. Add in the salt and just enough of the flour to make the dough pull away from the sides of the bowl.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead enough flour to make a soft dough. It should be smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough ball lightly, and cover. Place in a warm place where a draft cannot get to it and allow to rise about 1 hour.\nPrep a large baking pan (pizza pan works well) by either taking an oiled napkin and running it around the pan or line with parchment paper.\nPunch the dough down and allow to rest 10 minutes.\nOil your hands and place dough in the pan. Brush the top of the dough with oil then, using your fingers, make deep dimples in the dough, about 1/2 inch. Cover with plastic again and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400F(200C).\nTake the olives, feta and basil and spread on top of the foccacia. Sprinkle salt on top and place in oven. Bake 18 - 20 minutes  or until golden. Check about half way through and deflate any large bubbles with the poke of a knife.\nWhen done cooking, place on a rack to cool for about 15 - 20 minutes.\nThis bread is very versatile. You can make it into small mini loaves (as in the original recipe) or in a big one like I did. You can also top it with a number of different ingredients, just let your craving drive you :D!"},{"id":664650,"title":"Vegetarian Chinese Pot Stickers","image":"https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/664650-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","servings":24,"readyInMinutes":45,"sourceUrl":"https://www.foodista.com/recipe/KF58KP4Y/vegan-vegetarian-pot-stickers","sourceName":"Foodista","summary":"If you have roughly <b>45 minutes</b> to spend in the kitchen, Vegetarian Chinese Pot Stickers might be a super <b>dairy free</b> recipe to try.

Add the sprinkling of red pepper and garlic, followed by the beef and sausage, breaking up with a large spatula. I chose not to break mine up too much as I liked the larger bits of meat.  Turn and coat the meat with the onions and bacon till browned but not cooked through. As meat begins to brown, add the wine, I like to let the wine cook and bubble for about a minute to evaporate a bit. Next, add the lentils, carrots, beef stock, water and parmigiano rind. Cover the pot and set to a low simmer for 40 minutes (stirring every 10 minutes). Lastly, add the mushrooms, swiss chard, spinach and arugula.

It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long.

the crust. Place the graham crackers in a Ziploc bag, and with a rolling pin, crush them. My guy always comes around when it's time to do this, and does it for me. I think he likes it.\nIn a medium bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs with the sugar.\nAdd the melted butter, and mix well.\nPress the graham cracker mixture into a pie plate, and refrigerate for about a half hour.\nNow, the filling! Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.\nStir in the brown sugar (and molasses, if you're using it). Keep the heat low, and stir until the brown sugar is all melted and bubbly.\nAdd 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, and stir until the brown sugar and butter are dissolved.\nStir in the remaining 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, all of the milk, and the salt.\nRemove from heat, and let cool until lukewarm. I find this only takes about 10 minutes.\nMix together the cornstarch and water, and pour it into the pudding mixture.\nReheat over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture starts to thicken. It'll thicken fast with all that corn starch!\nTurn heat to low, and continue to stir vigorously while keeping it at a good simmer for about a minute.\nRemove from heat, and stir in the whiskey and vanilla. Whiskey wasn't in my original Butterscotch Pudding recipe, but I love the addition for this pie. Gives it a little extra somethin' somethin'.\nPour the pudding mixture into the chilled pie crust.\nCover with plastic wrap and chill for at least two hours.\nReady for the topping? Whip the 1 1/2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream with the wire whisk attachment on your stand mixer (you can do this by hand, but it would be quite the workout).\nAdd the sugar and vanilla to the cream while it's whipping. It's ready when soft peaks form. Yum.\nI'm stating the obvious, but remove the pie from the fridge and take off the plastic wrap.\nPile on the whipping cream. I like to spread it almost to the edges, but not quite - gotta give folks a glimpse of the actual pie yumminess!\nIf you want, garnish with a little shaved chocolate. I just took the carrot peeler to a Hershey bar.\nOr leave it plain.
